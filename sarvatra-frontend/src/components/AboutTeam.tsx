One day, I sneaked into my father\'s library and started reading the books on Indian Mythology. Though unsure of how much I understood at the time, it piqued my curiosity to delve deeply into Indian Scriptures. At Sarvatva, I found my calling as I began deciphering ancient wisdom and contributing to the 21st-centuryâ€™s quest for unwavering truth.',

I began questioning reality, wondering if this was all just a bubble that could burst in the blink of an eye. I embarked on a journey of discovery to seek answers to this profound mystery. It was a painful journey indeed, but I found solace in the deeper understanding of human psychology and how the mind works. The peace that I found, I wanted to share it with the world so that we can evolve together to higher levels of consciousness. With Sarvatva, I found my purpose.',
