This period of isolation sparked a curiosity, leading me to embark on a journey of discovery.<br/><br/> I found some answers in the deeper understanding of the branch of philosophy called metaphysics. The revelations resonated deeply with me. I realized that these insights were meant to be shared, and thus Sarvatva was born.',
